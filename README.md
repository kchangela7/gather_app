With online classes only, we need new ways to interact with our peers, form study groups, and make new friends. So we present, Gather, a new way to meet your classmates. Simply view a series of profiles with their courses and interests and match.

 # Why we need it
 Especially during the age of virtual learning, GroupMe is a good communication tool to stay in the loop; however, we all need 1-on-1 or small group interactions to keep up with the class, get help, and make new connections. 
 
 # How Gather can help
 Gather helps you find people in your classes and lets you decide whether you want to study with them based on the classes they take, majors, and interests! If you both want to study together, we open up a chat and give you the option to expand it as you make more mutual matches.

# Find friends, make study groups, join Gather.
