# gather

 With online classes only, we need new ways to interact with our peers, form study groups, and make new friends. So we present, Gather, new way of meeting your classmates.

 # Why we need it
 GroupMe is a good communication tool to stay in the loop, but we all need that 1-on-1 or small group interactions to be sure we're keeping up with the class and get help when we need it. 
 
 # How Gather can help
 Gather helps you find people in your classes and lets you decide whether you want to study with them based on the classes they take, majors, and interests! If you both want to study together, we open up a chat and give you the option to expand it as you find more mutual study buddies.
